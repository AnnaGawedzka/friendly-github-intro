        <h1>A Friendly Github Intro Workshop</h1>
        <small>Prepared for UBC, Vancouver, March 2016</small>
        <div class="meta-information">
            <p class="summary">
                This is a friendly introduction to Github – a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled. In this workshop we will introduce you to the Github ecosystem and help you get you comfortable navigating basic Github workflows. We will make sure that you leave the workshop aware of the best practices for developing projects on Github (e.g. writing a good “readme” or posting and labeling issues) and an understanding of how Github can help make your projects more readable and accessible. This workshop is developed for anyone looking for a solution to making projects – whether it be your research on arctic glaciers, the materials for an undergraduate course, your PHD thesis, or even a cookbook – more manageable. This workshop is geared towards all skill levels, but first-time and novice users are encouraged and prioritized.

        <h2 id="help">Help & code of conduct</h2>
          <h3>How can I ask questions?</h3>
          <p>
            Please feel free to ask any of the facilitators any questions you have - we're here to help!
          </p>
          <p>
            You should also try asking your neighbours as you're working through the exercises. Figuring out how to do this in pairs is much easier than struggling alone!
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a living <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/2016-02-08-friendly-github-intro">etherpad</a> where we will be collecting any questions from participants and answering either on a rolling basis or after the workshop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hop on the pad if you've got questions, comments, want to make notes as we're going along, or want to answer any of the questions.
          </p>

          <h3>Where can I find the workshop Code of Conduct?</h3>
            <p>
              You can find it <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/code-of-conduct">here</a>. Remember that this workship is aimed at beginners to git and GitHub, and there's no programming background required. It is very important that we ensure everyone feels welcome and that their contributions are valued. If you do not abide by the code of conduct and treat all members of the workshop with respect you will be asked to leave.
